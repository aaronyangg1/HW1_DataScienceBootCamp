Work on the Brooklyn Pedestrian Dataset: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/6fi9-q3ta/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

1)Filter the data to include only weekdays (Monday to Friday) and plot a line graph showing the pedestrian counts for each day of the week.

2) Track pedestrian counts on the Brooklyn Bridge for the year 2019 and analyze how different weather conditions influence pedestrian activity in that year. Sort the pedestrian count data by weather summary to identify any correlations( with a correlation matrix) between weather patterns and pedestrian counts for the selected year.

3) Implement a custom function to categorize time of day into morning, afternoon, evening, and night, and create a new column in the DataFrame to store these categories. Use this new column to analyze pedestrian activity patterns throughout the day.
